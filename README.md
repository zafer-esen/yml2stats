`yml2stats` can parse `.yml` files in a directory and gather data produced by [log2yml](https://github.com/zafer-esen/log2yml).

Can currently analyze and print (to stdout) results for each `.yml`` file in a directory passed as its argument.

Todo:
  - Better analysis of gathered data,
  - Better presentation of results (graphs and LaTeX tables).
  - Add `sbt assembly` and script for easy execution.
